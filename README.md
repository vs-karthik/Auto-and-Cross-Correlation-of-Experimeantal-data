 Description<br/>

               code1: By using the experimental data(hotwire) the normalized an=utocorrelation function as been plotted and also estimated the time integral scale.

               code2: By using the image files extracted from code present in Frames_extraction-and-time-series-analysis-for-experimental-data repository (not grey scale) by considering three different points normalised cross correlation and convection velocity of the 
                      travelling vortices has been calculated.

               code3: Data File Description:

                      The data file is named PIVdata.txt.
                      Data were acquired at 365 Hz with a total of 400 PIV realizations.
                      Grid size: 100 x 100.
                      There are 4 columns: x, y, U, V.
                      The first 10,000 rows correspond to the first PIV realization, the second 10,000 rows correspond to the second PIV realization, and so on.


                      Tasks:

                      Calculate:

                      Urms at all locations.
                      Umean at all locations.
                      Vmean at all locations.
                      Vrms at all locations.

                      it is basically Space correlation

                      Plot:

                      Velocity and RMS velocity profiles at x = 30 mm but along the y direction.
                      Correlation contours (r(∆x, ∆y)) with reference point at x = 30 mm and y = 0 mm.

                      Time Series:

                       Extract the time series at points P1(x=30, y=5), P2(x=33, y=5), and P3(x=36, y=5).
                       Plot the time series of the image intensity (grayscale values) at points P1, P2, and P3.
                       Find and plot the normalized correlation of the fluctuating u velocity at P1.
                       Find and plot the normalized correlation of the fluctuating velocity between the points P1 and P2, and between the points P1 and P3.

                       Plot ∆τ vs ∆x and determine the convection velocity of the traveling vortices.
